		<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
		<h3>The Arts</h3>
		<p>I am a fervent art passionate, especially of comptemporain works of art. I like to create, collect and admire pieces of art.</p>
		<p>One of my favourite painter is Yves Klein. He created the famous International Klein Blue and most of his works are made by this color </p>

		<p>I also love other types of artistic industies such as fashion and music.</p>
		<p>For those industries, Kanye West is my favourite artist. He is a singer, a designer, a performer, an artist and more. He is such an inspiration for me. Wether it is for his futuristic brand, Yeezy or his musics, I can put him first these different categories</p>
		<h3>The Sports</h3>
		<p>During all my life, I used to practice a lot of different sports. I start at the age of 1 by swimming, it's called the "baby swimmer" and I continued this sport which I still practice. When I was in primary and middle school, I did a lot of competitions but I had to stop because of a move.</p>
		<p>I practiced a lot of others sport, for example, I played golf and tennis, I rode horses and I have been sailing.</p>
		<h3>The Travels</h3>
		<p>I think travelling is the thing I prefer in life (after living ofc haha). Thanks to my parents, friends and grandparents, I taveled all around the world. I even had the opportunity to travel alone to learn foreign languages. My mixed origines allowed me to see part of my families anywhere in the world.</p>
		<p>From Europe to the Americas, by way of Africa, I visited a lot of countries. unfortunately, i never been in Asia and I would love to discover this culture.</p>
